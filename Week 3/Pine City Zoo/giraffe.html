                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its leopard-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.</p>
                
                <p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. They are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs.</p>
                
                <p>Giraffes are social animals that live in loose herds. Males establish dominance through "necking" contests where they swing their necks at each other. Females are responsible for raising the young.</p>
                
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the giraffes at G15, just beyond the research centre.</p>
