                <h3>DUSKY LEAF MONKEY</h3>
                <p>The dusky leaf monkey, spectacled langur, or spectacled leaf monkey (Trachypithecus obscurus) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. These monkeys are known for their distinctive appearance with white rings around their eyes that resemble spectacles.</p>
                
                <p>Dusky leaf monkeys are primarily leaf-eaters, though they also consume fruits, flowers, and occasionally insects. They live in groups of 5-20 individuals with a complex social structure. These monkeys are highly arboreal, spending most of their time in the trees where they move gracefully through the canopy.</p>
                
                <p>Their digestive systems are specially adapted to break down tough leaves, with a complex stomach similar to that of cows. They are generally quiet animals but communicate through various facial expressions and body postures.</p>
                
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the monkeys at the monkey cage near the Monkey Trail.</p>
