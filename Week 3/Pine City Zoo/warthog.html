                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>Phacochoerus is a genus of wild pigs in the family Suidae, known as warthogs. They are found in open and semiopen habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus.</p>
                
                <p>Warthogs are identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5 cm (10 in) long.</p>
                
                <p>Although they are capable of fighting (males fight each other during mating season), warthogs prefer to flee when threatened. They are fast runners and can run up to 48 km/h (30 mph). They will often reverse into burrows so they can defend themselves with their tusks if pursued.</p>
                
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</p>
