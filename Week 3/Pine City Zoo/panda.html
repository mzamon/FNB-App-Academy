                <h3>GIANT PANDA</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.</p>
                
                <p>Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
                
                <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived. The giant panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.</p>
