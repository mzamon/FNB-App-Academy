                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.</p>
                
                <p>Lions live in groups called prides which consist of related females, their cubs, and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator, although they scavenge when opportunities occur.</p>

Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator, although they scavenge when opportunities occur.</p>
